In the present project, EEG signals were recorded using a Mentalab Explore Pro system. This lightweight amplifier (27 g) supports eight channels (Fp1, Fp2, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, and O2) and can transmit data wirelessly over distances up to 10 meters. Notably, it enables extended observation periods of up to 12 continuous hours, making it well-suited for long-duration experiments.
Participants performed a putting task on an indoor artificial green. The participant completed 10 sessions, with 50 attempts in each session. Outcomes were categorized post hoc as either “Hit” ext_1 or ext_0 “Miss.” Throughout the sessions, EEG data were captured to explore the association between recorded brain activity and performance outcomes. 

The raw EEG data from the Explore Pro are organized in session-specific subfolders named 50-1 through 50-10, each representing one of the ten experimental sessions. Within every subfolder, two comma-separated value (CSV) files are stored for each trial: an EEG signal file (*_ExG.csv) containing continuous recordings with columns for TimeStamp and the eight channel voltages (ch1–ch8), and an event-marker file (*_Marker.csv) that provides trial-level labels and timing information with columns TimeStamp and Code. The Code field denotes the performance outcome—ext_0 for a miss and ext_1 for a hit—allowing precise alignment of behavioral events with corresponding EEG activity for subsequent analyses.
